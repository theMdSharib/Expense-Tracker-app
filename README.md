# expense

• Developed a expense tracker app to track the expenses of the user for the past week.

• Users can add new transaction into the app with the title, amount and the date of the transaction .

• The application will then calculate the expenses for the user and will show them as a list.

• The application also visualises user with the functionality of ’chart bar’ whereby user can view the expenses in the form of chat bar and will get real-time idea about on which day the transaction was the most among other days.

• Used Dart and Flutter to build and design the application.
